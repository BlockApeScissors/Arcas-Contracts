This is the Smart Contract repository for Arcas and the Skillstaking protocol.

We have deployed Skillstaking contracts to opbnb testnet for demo purposes.

The Plan:

Arcas is the community and DAO working on Arcas Champions, an unreal engine 5 competitive ape shooter.

The game implements the Skillstaking protocol, putting the best gamers in control and giving them revenue share through the tokenisation of their Matchmaking-Rank.

Note: Rank is a Gaming RWA combining Time and Skill, this is the most important data point for the Esports community.

The Arcas ecosystem and Skillstaking protocol will require a decentralised oracle network that validates Rank from the
game backend and that writes it on chain under the RankOracle.

In order to contend with cheating, we need to create an epoch based system that allows the DON to validate the data with AI trained by esports gamers.

The system can operate slowly and initially we use weekly on chain writes.

Over time we need to increase the efficiency, security and speed of this AI network.

The goal is to decentralise the validators of the system to large esports organisations
with their own AI bots in house.
