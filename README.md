This is the Smart Contract repository for Arcas - A compete & earn apeverse built by Binance incubted web3 gaming studio Block Ape Scissors.

The Arcas ecosystem is powered by the Arcas governance and utility token, of which there are 100 million total supply. The Arcas token is the
v2 of the old Block Ape Scissors token which was deprecated and migrated on the 30/09/2023 with full information available here:

All liquidity has been migrated and is now secured under a 3/4 multisig held by various team members under:

bnb:0x24976a29d3c710EA24F1Eb760c0B677be0AB21df

Additionally 33% of token supply has been locked under this multisig for future use at the teams discretion.

The LP airdrop and redemption is still being operated and as such some LP tokens are still under the deployer wallet.

1. ARCAS token deployed here:

2. Arcas Team Vesting Manager deployed here:
https://bscscan.com/address/0x14d6d8b626f67d0bea717ef3eee899e9b466827a#code

Funds have not yet been deployed in the manager pending audit.

The Vesting manager has been preset with a vesting timeline:

Start Block: 34096534 (Expected 1st Dec 2023)

End Block: 44608534 (Expected 1st Dec 2024)

This is immutable and will unlock tokens in a linear fashion over the 12 month period to the associated vesting wallets.

New vestings added after the 1st of December follow the same unlock schedule, meaning recipient wallets will be able to claim
some tokens immediately.
